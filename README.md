# A Note from the Author

THIS WHOLE PROJECT WAS CREATED, DESIGNED, CODED, AND MANIFESTED BY ME, [BRETT CORNICK](https://github.com/bcornick), AFTER HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOBS WERE GRANTED NO INTERVIEWS.

"Some even say it's me, maybe I'm not too bright
I beg to differ, safe to say I'm no quitter
Safe even from the bitter taste of Twitter
Where we get to kick around intellectual litter
And while the unfit just got unfitter
Time to cause a commotion" -[Maxi Jazz & Vintage Culture](https://open.spotify.com/track/2qf9Ad1hgLF5oM9SdMJdDU?si=d150d6ab63c3430a√•)
